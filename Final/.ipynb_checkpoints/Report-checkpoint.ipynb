    "London is one of the world hottest travel destinations with travellers from all over the world. With its famous landmarks and iconic sights, the number of attractions to visit can be overwhelming to the first-time visitors who are trying to make a travel plan. To find the best restaurants after visiting each attraction is another challenging task to achieve for first-time visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of this project: firstly, is to decide the must-go attractions of London. The must-go appeals will be selected based on popular reviews. In this project, we use a foursquare user's (Gilson Missawa) detailed must-travel list in London as a reference. There are 136 attractions recommended in Gilson's list. We randomly chose 78 from the list (due to the limited requests we can get from Foursquare API as a free user). In the future, we can extend the possible destinations by adding and comparing the travel guidelines from different sources. In this project, we recommend the activity based on the current location of the visitor. Second, to find the best restaurant close to the must-go attractions. In the second step, we explore the area close to the previous activity venue and get the food venues within a radius of 100 metres. The food venues are clustered based on the rating, price tier, number of likes, and the location using k-means clustering. The restaurants belonging to the different clusters are marked on the map with different colours. We believe this will help the visitor to make a more comfortable choice to focus on a smaller number of options that have similar attributes.\n"

Then we used the <a href=\"https://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/haversine/\">Haversine Formula</a> to calculate the distance between the hotel and all the places recommended to visit. By sorting the data frame by distance, the closest venue is advised. In our case, it is the Ambassadors Theatre. We can extract all the relevant information about this position from the Foursquare database, such as the rating, latitude, longitude, and descriptions. If the first recommended location is not of interest of the visitor, he/she can easily find the next closest recommended place to visit based on other criteria.\n",

    "### 4.2. Recommendation Strategy\n",
    "In this project, a relatively simple strategy is used. The recommendation is based on distance and the reviews of all other visitors in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "A better strategy can be an overall weighted score, considering the distance, price, ratings, and other factors. However, a rule-based recommendation strategy has a limitation. Based on the same rule, no matter how optimised the rule it is, different people will all get the same recommendations. The best recommendation we believe is a personalised recommendation. Many apps are making personalised recommendations, such as google map is able to recommend the nearby restaurants based on the current location. I don't know how many people are already living a life that follows the recommendation given by the apps. I don't think there will be a lot. Most people are still more comfortable to plan where to go before embarking a journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can think of two reasons for this tendency. First is that recommendation is always a list of places. To choose from a list of recommendations is like to choose from all the options to me. I prefer a piece of single advice. It is like you heard from a friend \"You must try that restaurant!\" That is more persuasive than a list of recommendations. The second reason is the balance between risk and surprise. We want to recommend something wholly new, but you knew you would have a good time there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I think that the recommendation is both predictive and straightforward. There will be only one recommendation given, and this recommendation is based on the experience of the visitor to suggest something new."

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we developed a sequential recommendation framework. London is an example. The objective is to help the first-time visitor to find a place to visit and then recommend a place to have lunch. The framework can be iterative with further development. By iterating the recommendation, the next place-to-visit can be recommended based on the restaurant the visitor has visited. To make it more flexible and hopefully more personalised, instead of using rule-based recommendation, we would like to incorporate data-driven recommendation. In this project, we demonstrate that a restaurant can be recommended based on k-means clustering result. The data taken into consideration is not limited to those used in this project (rating, number of likes, price, etc.). With more personalised data, we hope that this could be a personalised tour guide that tailored for each traveller."
